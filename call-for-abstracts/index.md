The organizers of the {{ site.saltnum }}th annual meeting of Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT{{ site.saltnum }}) invite submission of abstracts for 30-minute oral presentations (with an additional 10 minutes for questions) or posters on any topic in natural language semantics with relevance to linguistic theory. 

SALT{{ site.saltnum }} will be held in-person in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Submission details

**<span class="alert">Deadline:</span> Monday, December 15, 2025**, 23:59 (UTC)

Submissions should be made via the SALT{{ site.saltnum }} OpenReview site (<a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=saltconf.github.io/SALT/2026/Conference">link</a>). We expect to notify authors of their acceptance in April 2026.


<hr/>

## Requirements

Abstracts must be anonymous. The main text should be at most 2 pages (A4) in length, with an optional third page for examples, references, or figures. The abstract should use a 12pt font and 3 cm margins (for A4) on all four sides. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF file. These limitations will be strictly enforced.

SALT 36 will feature a poster session. Poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the proceedings. Poster presenters will be asked to give a short lightning round presentation prior to the poster session.


<hr/>

## Policies

Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the sole author of at most one abstract.

SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been published or have been accepted for publication. In addition, preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated at other major conferences. We therefore request that authors indicate prior, pending, or planned presentations of their papers along with their contact information when they submit their abstracts.

## Proceedings

All papers presented at the conference (including posters) will be published in a SALT{{ site.saltnum }} volume following the conclusion of the conference.
