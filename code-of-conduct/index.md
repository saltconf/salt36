## Code of Conduct

<hr/>

### Civility

All participants of SALT34 are subject to the [LSAâ€™s Civility Policy](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/lsa-civility-policy). 

<hr/>

### Enforcement

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep SALT34 a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

Participants must follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities; people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

<hr/>

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to conference staff as soon as possible. Harassment and other violations of the Civility Policy reduce the value of our event for everyone. People like you make our scientific community a better place, and we want you to be happy here.
